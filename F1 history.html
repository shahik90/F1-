    <div class="para"><p><strong>The origins of Formula 1</strong> trace back to the early <em>20th century, when
         Grand Prix motor racing</em> began in Europe. The first recognized Grand Prix
          took place in <em>1906 in France</em>, and throughout the <em>1920s</em> and <em>1930s</em>, manufacturers 
          like <em>Bugatti, Alfa Romeo, and Mercedes-Benz</em> dominated the sport. <strong>Racing was largely
           unregulated, and while it attracted huge crowds, it was extremely dangerous.</strong> <strong>The 
           outbreak of <em>World War II</em> halted racing activities, but once peace returned, efforts
            began to formalize a <em>global racing championship.</em></strong></p>
            <p>In 1950,<strong>the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)</strong> launched the first official <em>Formula One World
                 Championship.</em> The inaugural race took place at <em>Silverstone</em> in the <em>United Kingdom.</em> Early champions like <em>Giuseppe
                  Farina</em> and the legendary <em>Juan Manuel Fangio</em>, who won five titles, helped establish F1's global reputation. Cars during
                   this era were <strong>front-engined, with limited safety features, making the sport perilous.</strong> The 1950s and 1960s also saw the 
                   rise of iconic teams like <em>Ferrari and Lotus</em>, and the transition to <em>rear-engined cars</em> marked a major technological shift.</p>
<p>The <em>1960s</em> marked a shift in <strong><em>innovation and competition</em></strong>, especially with the rise of British teams like <strong>Lotus, BRM, and Cooper</strong>. This era introduced significant technical changes, such as <em><strong>rear-engine car designs</strong></em>, which revolutionized <em>performance and handling</em>. Drivers like <strong>Jim Clark, Graham Hill, and Jack Brabham</strong> became household names. <strong>Brabham also became the only driver to win a championship in a car bearing his own name.<strong></p></div>
